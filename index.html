    <p class="para">Once upon a time, this happened to me when I was living in Delhi in 2010, as my father works in the Indian Air Force we have to shift to many locations after specific years. So here's the story, there lived a street dog and her three adorable puppies. They found shelter and warmth in the parking area of my apartment complex. Little did I know, they were about to become a part of my daily life and create unforgettable memories.<br><br>

        In that doggy family, the mother dog was a guardian fiercely protective of her precious pups. Every morning, as the sun painted the sky with hues of gold, they would eagerly await their breakfast in front of my door making little howling sounds so that I can understand that they were hungry. What set them apart was their unique taste â€“ they weren't like the typical street dogs who all are very specific about the food. No, these furry friends have devoured everything on their plates. They will eat savored homemade chapati with sabzi or chapati & milk.<br><br>
        
        As I grew, so did the bond between us. I was in the 4th grade then, and my school bus stop was far from home. This posed a small challenge for my family, as someone needed to accompany me to the bus stop every morning. But here's where my dog family became my unexpected guardians.
        
        With wagging tails and eager eyes, the three puppies and their mother would become my loyal bodyguards. As I would step out of my apartment, they would follow me, walking beside me as I made my way to the bus stop. It was as if they had taken it upon themselves to ensure I was safe and sound.
        
        Once I hopped onto the school bus, I would steal a glance back at them, standing there, watching over me. Their presence brought a sense of security and comfort that only a true friend can provide. And then, as the bus rumbled away, they would slowly amble back home, knowing their duty was done for the day.<br><br>
        
        Those days were magical, etching memories that time could never erase. The loyal companionship of that street dog and her puppies not only offered me a daily escort but also filled my mornings with warmth and a unique connection to the world of animals.<br><br>
        
        As the years went by, life took us on separate paths, but the memory of that street dog family's unwavering companionship stayed with me. It taught me that friendship and protection could come from the most unexpected corners of life and that even creatures with fur and tails could touch our hearts in ways we never imagined.</p>
